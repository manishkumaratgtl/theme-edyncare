            Because we both went through awful experiences when arranging care. 
            Poor service. No choice. No continuity. Expensive. 
        </h2>
        <h2>
            So we thought weâ€™d try something new.
            A personal, professional and reliable approach.
            Powered by compassion, consistency and technology.
